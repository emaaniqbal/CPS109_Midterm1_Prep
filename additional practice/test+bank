CPS 109 suggested Programming Exercises
addtional practice

NOTE: These are old test questions from past exams/test in beginner python CS courses (@uni lvl). For some questions,
values have been changed from og question, but these should all be doable!

Instructions
===============================
THESE ARE VERY COMMON STRUCT TO TEST QUESTIONS.
This module contians addtional questions to help prep for midterm 1.

To test the functions, just run cell, and the auto test should occur
if you are in pycharm, right click and press run file (or run doctests)

i.e of fully passed:
    37 tests in 13 items.
    37 passed and 0 failed.
    Test passed.

i.e of failure:

    1 items had failures:
       1 of   3 in __main__.makes10
    37 tests in 13 items.
    36 passed and 1 failed.
    ***Test Failed*** 1 failures.

    ^ that is refering to this test:
    #>>> makes10(9, 10)
    False

This file is an open resource for your learning! I will also provide
file with all the blank fxns and the unit test file to simulate a test
env.
