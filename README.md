# CPS109_Midterm1_Prep
TMU: CPS 109 FALL 2024 Prep: MIDTERM 1

Description
===============================



This Python repo contains the blank problems of assigned lab questions, mock-quiz questions, and more to help you get started in prepping for your CPS 109 midterm. 



It is suggested to solve these problems before moving on to the CCPS 109 questions provided on your D2L (see announcements). You will struggle to complete the CCPS 109 problems if you cannot do these. Those CCPS questions are addtional problems amp up the challenge - some are like  "thinking" questions you may have done in your highschool courses. 



**Problems/Notes are still to be added. If you have requests for problems/questions to be solved, contact me** 



In general, make sure you have a good grasp of the concepts/ problems provided here.



You are provided with a blank file and test file.
Download the files and ensure they are in the same location (see image).

You may test in 2-ways. Unit testing or testing via doc-string.

**YOU ARE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIT TESTING FOR YOUR MIDTERM.**

To test the doc-strings, simply run the file, and it will inform you how many tests have passed. 


To test your unit tests, RUN THE UNIT TEST FILE. 


These are both methods of testing, sometimes testing with doc-strings is easier if you encounter errors with your unit-testing- thus, I have provided the 2 means to testing functions. 



The functions are blank for you to solve. Note that some have the pass parameter, remove that when you start creating/testing your function. 


**Solutions to problems to be added**
